# Textual Entailment Summarize

In my 2023 undergraduate thesis, I pioneered an extraction summarization approach employing textual entailment processes using SNLI Data. Implementing (Bowman et al., 2015) model, the system achieved an impressive 76% accuracy during testing. The model discerns pairs of sentences with similar meanings, incorporating them into summarization candidates. The innovative technique ranks and prioritizes these candidates, culminating in the creation of coherent paragraphs for enhanced textual summarization.
